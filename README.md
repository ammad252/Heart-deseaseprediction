# Heart Disease Prediction

The Heart Disease Prediction project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health indicators. The project involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, and standardizing the dataset to improve model accuracy.
Key Steps:
1)Data Loading
2)Handling Missing Values
3)Target Variable Distribution
4)Feature Scaling
5)Train-Test Split
6)Model Training:
